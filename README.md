# cryptopals-haskell
Work-in-progress solutions to the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://www.cryptopals.com/) in Haskell.
This project is structured using [stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/)

## Verifying the Solutions
Test cases are given on the [Cryptopals website](https://www.cryptopals.com/) to verify solutions to the challenges. These test cases are implemented using HSpec. To run the tests, use:
```
stack test
```
